This is a **Next.js** project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It leverages the power of React and server-side rendering for building web applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/I-Macharia/ArdhiOnChainProd.git
   cd ArdhiOnChainProd

2. **Install Dependencies**

Depending on your package manager of choice, run one of the following commands:

npm install
#### or
yarn install
#### or
pnpm install
#### or
bun install

3. **Run the Development Server**

Start the development server with:

npm run dev
#### or
yarn dev
#### or
pnpm dev
#### or
bun dev

4. View in Browser 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application running.

## Editing the Application 
You can start editing the application by modifying the file located at `app/page.js`. The page will auto-update as you make changes.

## Font Optimization 
This project utilizes `next/font` to automatically optimize and load the **Inter** font, which is a custom Google Font.
